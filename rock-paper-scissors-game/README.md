I had to implement a Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

It was a really hard challenge for me (my first advanced level challenge), I didn't know a lot of techniques. I did it entirely in JavaScript, html and CSS. I learned how to make glowing effect, set session storage, create inset shadows, change the meta name of the file so that it displays the right image on social networks, how to effectively use display:none to hide content when necessary and many more other things. It was a very useful project for me.

I am very proud of the design, working logic and implementation, I put a lot of efforts into it and I feel pretty satisfied. It showed me the beauty of using JavaScript and what it can do with websites. I hope to learn more in future projects.
